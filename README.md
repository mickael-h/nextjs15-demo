# Next.js 15 Hacker News Top Stories Demo

A modern, production-grade demo app built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It fetches and displays paginated Hacker News stories, with author details, dark mode, robust testing, and strict code quality enforcement.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Next.js 15 App Router** with React Server Components (RSC) and Client Components
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and dark mode (all styling via utility classes in `className`)
- **API proxying**: All HN API requests go through your Next.js backend
- **Pagination**: Browse stories with accessible, robust pagination controls
- **Link Previews**: Rich previews for story URLs (image, title, description, logo) using metascraper
- **Client-side image handling**: All external images use a custom `ClientImage` (Next.js `<Image />` with custom loader, no domain restrictions)
- **Author details**: View karma and account creation date for each story's author
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and semantic HTML
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, and code coverage
- **Prettier, ESLint, Husky, lint-staged**: Enforced code style and pre-commit checks
- **Scroll restoration**: When returning from story detail to the list, your scroll position is restored

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone and Install**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mickael-h/nextjs15-demo.git
cd nextjs15-demo
npm install
```

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following:

```env
# The base URL for the official Hacker News API (must end with a slash)
HN_API_URL=https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/

# The public site URL for client-side fetches (no trailing slash)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

- `HN_API_URL` is used by server-side API routes to fetch HN data.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is used by client-side code and hooks to call your own API endpoints.

### 3. **Run the App**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üß™ Testing, Linting & Type Checking

- **Run all tests:**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **Check code coverage:**
  ```bash
  npm test -- --coverage
  ```
- **Lint and format code:**
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run format
  ```
- **Check type validity:**
  ```bash
  npm run typecheck
  ```

### Pre-commit Hook (Husky v10+)

- Husky and lint-staged are set up to run Prettier and ESLint on staged files before every commit.
- The `.husky/pre-commit` file now contains only the commands to run (no `husky.sh`):
  ```sh
  npx lint-staged
  npm test
  ```
- If you add new hooks, just add your commands directly to the relevant `.husky/*` file.

### Prettier Ignore

- The `.prettierignore` file ensures Prettier does **not** format:
  - `.next` (build output)
  - `node_modules` (dependencies)
  - All config files matching `*.config.*` (e.g., `next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`)
  - All files matching `*.rc` (e.g., `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`)

## üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture & Decisions

### **Directory Structure**

- `src/app/` ‚Äî Next.js App Router, API routes, pages, and layout
- `src/components/` ‚Äî UI components (StoryList, StoryCard, StoryDetail, LinkPreview, ClientImage, etc.)
- `src/hooks/` ‚Äî Custom React hooks (for `useAuthor`)
- `src/lib/` ‚Äî Pure backend logic (for HN API fetchers, link preview scraping, easily unit tested)

### **API Proxying**

- All requests to the Hacker News API are proxied through `/api/hn/top20`, `/api/hn/user/[username]`, and `/api/preview` routes.
- This enables error handling and lets you add business logic to requests (like sorting, pagination, or scraping).

### **Component Design**

- **StoryList**: Handles list/detail state, renders `StoryCard` and `StoryDetail`, preserves scroll position when toggling views.
- **StoryCard**: Clickable, accessible card for each story.
- **StoryDetail**: Shows full story info and author details, fetches author data via `useAuthor`.
- **LinkPreview**: Shows a rich preview for story URLs, using metascraper and client-side image handling.
- **ClientImage**: Renders all external images using Next.js `<Image />` with a custom loader and `unoptimized`, bypassing domain restrictions.
- **useAuthor**: Custom hook for fetching and caching author info, using the public API route.

### **Pagination**

- The app supports paginated stories, with accessible, robust pagination controls.
- Pagination state is reflected in the URL for shareability and navigation.

### **Link Preview & Image Handling**

- Story details show a rich link preview (image, title, description, logo) using metascraper.
- All preview logic is in `src/lib/preview.ts` and proxied via `/api/preview`.
- All images are rendered client-side with `ClientImage` (Next.js `<Image />` with custom loader and `unoptimized`), so there are no domain restrictions and no `<img>` tags.

### **SWR Data Fetching**

- SWR is used for client-side data fetching.
- Automatic refetching on window focus is **disabled** for a stable UX.

### **Testing Philosophy**

- All business logic is extracted to pure functions/modules for easy unit testing.
- Hooks are tested with real fetch mocking, not just stubs.
- UI is tested with React Testing Library for realistic user flows.

### **Code Quality**

- **Prettier** and **ESLint** enforce consistent style and catch errors.
- **Husky** and **lint-staged** ensure only well-formatted, linted code is committed.
- **TypeScript** is used everywhere for safety and maintainability.
